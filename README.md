# Intro-Project
Student grade calculator and database. 

This 4-class Java program was created as the final programming lab in the lab sequence for COSC 10403 at Texas Christian University.
It features a simple GUI of Java Swing components, a MVC formatted program, and an additional student class to store student info. 
The program allows you to calculate a student's final average based on 4 exam scores, a lab average, and their corresponding weight. Then
the user may add this data to the database (up to 100 students) and display the data in a JList. Options to delete, modify, sort, and 
empty are available.
